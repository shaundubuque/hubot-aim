  "readme": "Description\n===========\n\nnode-oscar is an OSCAR protocol module for [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n* [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) -- tested with v0.2.6\n* An AIM or ICQ account -- Note: Only ICQ UINs will work and they must be a String when supplied as the username. For new ICQ accounts, they do not give you your ICQ UIN right away (you log in by email address). For these new accounts, you can find your UIN by: logging with the ICQ web client and editing your profile OR by going here (https://www.icq.com/karma/login_page.php), clicking the \"Enable Log In With an Email\" link, and logging in (your UIN will be displayed on the next page).\n\n\nExample\n=======\n\nSee test.js for example API usage.\n\n\nAPI\n===\n\nnode-oscar exposes one object: **OscarConnection**.\n\n#### Data types\n\n* _User_ is an Object representing information about a particular user. The following are all valid properties but may not always be filled in:\n    * **name** - A String containing the user (screen) name.\n    * **fullname** - A String containing the user's personal full name.\n    * **warnLevel** - An Integer representing the user's current warning level.\n    * **class** - A bit field indicating the type of user (see the USER\\_CLASSES constants).\n    * **memberSince** - A Date representing the date and time the user created their account.\n    * **onlineSince** - A Date representing the date and time the user logged on.\n    * **idleMins** - An Integer containing the number of minutes the user has been marked as idle. Note: the client actually tells AOL when to start and stop counting idle time, so this value could be unreliable.\n    * **flags** - A bit field containing various flags for the user (see the USER\\_FLAGS constants).\n    * **status** - A bit field containing the user's current status (see the USER\\_STATUSES constants).\n    * **IP** - A String containing the user's IP address.\n    * **capabilities** - An Array of Arrays that indicates what the user's client is capable of (see the CAPABILITIES constants).\n    * **instanceNum** - An Integer that indicates which instance of the user this is. This is filled in if the user's client is allowing simultaneous log-ons and they are currently logged on more than once.\n    * **profileSetOn** - A Date representing the date and time the user set their current profile.\n    * **awaySetOn** - A Date representing the date and time the user set themselves as away.\n    * **countryCode** - A String of length 2 indicating the user's country of origin.\n    * **statusMsg** - A String representing the user's custom status message.\n    * **mood** - A String containing a short extended status message for ICQ users.\n\n\nOscarConnection Events\n----------------------\n\n* **warn**(Integer, Integer[, String, Integer]) - Fires when another user warns you. The first argument is your old warning level and the second is your new warning level. If the third and fourth arguments are supplied, then it was a non-anonymous warning, in which case the third and fourth arguments are the user name and user warning level respectively.\n\n* **contactonline**(User) - Fires when someone logs on. The User argument is the user signing on.\n\n* **contactoffline**(User) - Fires when someone logs off. The User argument is the user signing off.\n\n* **contactupdate**(User) - Fires when information about someone changes. The User argument is the user whose details changed.\n\n* **im**(String, User, Integer[, Date]) - Fires when a message is received from another user. The first argument is the text of the message, the second argument is the sender, the third argument is a bit field containing the message flags (see the IM\\_FLAGS constants). The fourth argument is supplied for offline messages and indicates the date and time the message was sent.\n\n* **chatinvite**(User, String, String) - Fires when a chat invitation has been received. The first argument is the sender, the second argument is the chat room name, and the third argument is the invitation message (if available).\n\n* **missed**(User, Integer, Integer) - Fires when the server tells us someone failed while sending us a message. The first argument is the sender, the second argument is the number of messages, and the third argument is the reason (see the IM\\_MISSED\\_REASONS constants).\n\n* **typing**(String, Integer) - Fires when someone starts or stops typing to us or has entered some text. The first argument is the user name and the second argument is the type of notification (see the TYPING\\_NOTIFY constants).\n\n* **chatusersjoin**(String, Array) - Fires when someone joins a chat room you are currently in. The first argument is the chat room name and the second argument is the list of _User_ objects joining the chat room.\n\n* **chatusersleave**(String, Array) - Fires when someone leaves a chat room you are currently in. The first argument is the chat room name and the second argument is the list of _User_ objects leaving the chat room.\n\n* **chatmsg**(String, String) - Fires when someone sends a message to a chat room you are currently in. The first argument is the chat room name and the second argument is the message text.\n\n* **icon**(String, Buffer, String) - Fires when a user's buddy icon has been received. The first argument is the user name, the second argument is the raw icon data, and the third argument indicates the icon size ('small' or 'normal' currently).\n\n* **added**(String) - Fires when someone adds you to their buddy list. The argument is the user name.\n\n* **close**(Boolean) - Fires when the connection is completely closed (similar to net.Stream's close event). The specified Boolean indicates whether the connection was terminated due to a transmission error or not.\n\n* **end**() - Fires when the connection is ended (similar to net.Stream's end event).\n\n* **error**(Error) - Fires when an exception/error occurs (similar to net.Stream's error event). The given Error object represents the error raised.\n\n\nOscarConnection Properties\n--------------------------\n\n* **icon** - An Object representing the logged in user's buddy icon:\n    * **datetime** - An Integer representing the UNIX timestamp of when the icon was set.\n    * **data** - A Buffer containing the raw icon data (must be 7168 bytes or less).\n\n* **me** - A _User_ object for the logged in user.\n\n* **contacts** - An Object containing user-related information, such as your current buddy list, that is populated upon login and updated during the session:\n    * **lastModified** - A Date containing the date and time the buddy list was last modified.\n    * **list** - An Object containing the logged in user's buddy list.
